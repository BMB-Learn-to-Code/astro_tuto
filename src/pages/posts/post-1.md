# My first blog post

Published on January 29, 2026 by Stern Lerner

Welcome to my _new blog!_ This is my first post where I will be sharing my journey of learning Astro and web development.

## What I've accomplished so far

1. **Setting up**: Set up my Astro project
2. **Learning the basics**: Learned about components, pages, and layouts, eg. creating new `.astro` files and placing them in `src/pages`
3. **Creating content**: Started writing my first blog post


## What's next

I will finish setting up my blog and start sharing more about my learning experiences, tips, and tutorials on Astro and web development.
